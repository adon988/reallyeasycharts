reallyeasycharts
================

This is a very simple web service designed to get you from Point A to Point B as quickly as possible, where Point A is not having a chart and Point B is having a chart.

It's powered by [HighCharts](www.highcharts.com), [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), and [tinycolor](https://github.com/bgrins/TinyColor).

See it live [here](http://reallyeasycharts.herokuapp.com).
